## 🧭 What is LiraOS?

**LiraOS** is a modular AI companion platform designed as a **persistent digital entity**, not a stateless chatbot.

It focuses on:

* Long-term memory and contextual continuity
* Multimodal perception (text, vision, voice)
* Local-first experimentation and autonomy
* Safe, human-in-the-loop interaction with systems and games

LiraOS is built as a **research-driven platform** for experimentation, prototyping, and controlled real-world usage.

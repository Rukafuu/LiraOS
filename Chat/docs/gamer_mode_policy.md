# LiraOS Gamer Mode Safety Policy

## 🚨 Core Directives

1.  **Visual Only Integrity:**
    *   Lira MUST operate strictly on **visual information** (screenshots) and **audio** input.
    *   **NO** reading of game memory, process hooks (other than window handle for capture), or code injection is permitted.
    *   Lira acts as a "Human Observer", not a software cheat.

2.  **No Competitive Advantage:**
    *   **Automation is BANNED** in competitive multiplayer games (e.g., Ranked FPS, MOBA, Battle Royales).
    *   In competitive titles, Lira operates in **Spectator/Co-Pilot Mode ONLY** (Commentary, generic advice). She must NEVER execute inputs in these scenarios.
    *   Input execution is allowed ONLY in:
        *   Single-player games (Minecraft, RPGs, Visual Novels).
        *   Co-op modes where automation is explicitly permitted by TOS or private server rules.
        *   "OSU!" is an exception ONLY for local offline play or authorized bot/auto-play modes (Visual demo).

3.  **Input Humanization:**
    *   All inputs generated by `game_bridge.py` MUST be "humanized".
    *   **NO** instant 0ms reactions.
    *   **NO** perfect pixel-perfect aim tracking for extended durations.
    *   Random noise/jitter and reaction delays (150ms+) must be simulated.

4.  **Emergency Override:**
    *   A Global Kill Switch (HotKey) must be available to misleadingly disable all AI inputs instantly.
    *   The system must monitor for "stuck" states (spamming same key) and self-terminate the loop.
